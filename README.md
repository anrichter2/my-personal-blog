## Description

The ultimate goal of this project was to create a functional two-page blog posting website. The first page of the website would be comprised of a form that takes in a users blog post information, and then upon submitting the information the user is taken to the second page of the website. The website would then utilize javaScript to save the users blog post information in local storage and then dynamically display the users information in the form of an actual blog post. On top of that the website would also feature a light/dark mode toggle that uses both javaScript and CSS to change the background and text color of the page.
